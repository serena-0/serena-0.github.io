We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent beha…",

The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work…",
